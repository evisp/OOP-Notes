# üìö **Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java**

## ‚ú® **What is OOP?**

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm that uses objects to design software. Instead of focusing solely on functions, OOP organizes code around *objects*‚Äîdata structures that combine both data (attributes) and methods (behavior).

### Why OOP?

- **Modularity**: Breaks down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.
- **Reusability**: Code can be reused across multiple projects.
- **Maintainability**: Easy to modify and maintain due to clear structure.
- **Scalability**: Simplifies development as your software grows.

## üéØ **Applications of OOP**

OOP is used in a variety of real-world applications, from small programs to complex systems. Here are a few examples:

- **Web Applications**: Java is widely used to build scalable web services.
- **Mobile Applications**: Android apps are developed using Java or Kotlin, both of which are OOP-based.
- **Game Development**: Game objects like players, enemies, and environments are modeled as objects.
- **Enterprise Systems**: Large systems (e.g., banking software) often use OOP principles to manage complex workflows.

## üß† **Key Concepts of OOP in Java**

OOP has four main concepts:


1. **Classes and Objects**: Define the structure and behavior of real-world entities.
2. **Encapsulation**: Protects data by restricting direct access to it.
3. **Inheritance**: Promotes code reuse by allowing one class to inherit from another.
4. **Polymorphism**: Allows methods to have different behaviors based on context.


### 1. üèó **Classes and Objects**

- **Class**: A blueprint or template for creating objects.
- **Object**: An instance of a class; it has data (attributes) and behaviors (methods).


Sure! Here are concise paragraphs for **Class** and **Object** in clear, simple terms:

### **Class**:  
A **class** in Java is like a blueprint or template that defines what objects of that type will look like and how they will behave. It serves as a plan that outlines two main components: **properties** (also called attributes or fields), which hold data, and **methods**, which define actions or behaviors. For example, a class `Car` might have properties like `model` and `year` and methods like `drive()` or `stop()`. A class doesn't store actual data on its own; instead, it defines the structure that its objects will follow.

### **Object**:  
An **object** is an instance of a class, meaning it's a real example created from that blueprint. When you create an object, you're giving life to the class by filling in the actual data for its properties and using its methods to perform actions. For example, if `Car` is the class, an object of that class could be `myCar`, with properties like `model = "Toyota"` and `year = 2024`. The object can also use methods like `myCar.drive()` to perform tasks.

**Example:**
```java
class Car { 
    // Attributes
    String model;
    int year;

    // Constructor
    Car(String model, int year) {
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    // Method
    void displayDetails() {
        System.out.println("Model: " + model + ", Year: " + year);
    }
}

// Main class
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Creating an object of the class
        Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", 2024);
        myCar.displayDetails(); 
    }
}
```

### 2. üîí **Encapsulation**

Encapsulation is the practice of **hiding an object's internal data** and only exposing necessary information to the outside world. This is done by marking the object's attributes as `private` to restrict direct access and then providing **getter** and **setter** methods, which are `public`, to control how the data is accessed or modified. Encapsulation helps protect the integrity of an object's data and ensures it can only be changed in controlled ways.

Here's how encapsulation looks in the `Car` class example:

**Example:**
```java
class Car {
    // Private properties
    private String model;
    private int year;

    // Constructor
    public Car(String model, int year) {
        this.model = model;
        this.year = year;
    }

    // Getter for model
    public String getModel() {
        return model;
    }

    // Setter for model
    public void setModel(String model) {
        this.model = model;
    }

    // Getter for year
    public int getYear() {
        return year;
    }

    // Setter for year
    public void setYear(int year) {
        this.year = year;
    }
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car myCar = new Car("Toyota", 2020);
        System.out.println(myCar.getModel()); 

        myCar.setYear(2024); 
        System.out.println(myCar.getYear()); 
    }
}
```

### Key changes
- The `model` and `year` attributes in the `Car` class are marked as `private`, preventing direct access from outside the class.
- **Getter** and **setter** methods are used to access and modify the `model` and `year` properties safely.
- Encapsulation ensures that changes to the car's details, like the model or year, are made in a controlled and structured way.
